"""robot_state_publisher for the SO-ARM101.

    ros2 launch so101_description viz.launch.py            # waits for /joint_states
    ros2 launch so101_description viz.launch.py demo:=true # joints frozen at 0 (smoke test)

Publishes /robot_description and the TFs of the arm. Visualization: run rviz2
from the control container (X11) — see docker/docker-compose.yml.

IMPORTANT: without a node publishing /joint_states (your driver_node!), the joint
TFs do not exist → the arm appears "in pieces" in RViz. This is expected,
not a bug: publish sensor_msgs/JointState from your driver.
demo:=true launches a fake joint_state_publisher (zero pose) to check
the display chain independently of your code.
